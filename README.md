#### Take-Home Code Challenge

I created a simple single page react.js app that pulls information from this endpoint  http://private-227b9-jsonapifizzbuzz.apiary-mock.com/messages.
I created this application using create-react-app and react router. I used axios to make the api calls and react router to add a /messages route.
